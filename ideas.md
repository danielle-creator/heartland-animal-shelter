**Design Movement:** Editorial Warmth — inspired by modern nonprofit storytelling magazines (think ASPCA annual reports, National Geographic conservation issues)

**Core Principles:**
1. Emotion-first: every section leads with a face — animal or human — before text
2. Asymmetric tension: content blocks alternate between full-bleed photo left / text right and vice versa
3. Bold typographic hierarchy: oversized display numbers for stats, tight tracking for labels
4. Purposeful restraint: white space is generous, palette is disciplined (red, teal, warm off-white, charcoal)

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary Red (#C8102E): urgency, love, action — used for primary CTAs and accent rules
- Teal (#0D9488): calm, trust, life — used for secondary CTAs, section backgrounds, icon fills
- Warm Off-White (#FAF7F2): background warmth that feels like a home, not a clinic
- Charcoal (#1C1917): body text, grounding
- Emotional intent: red + teal together signal "passion + care" — the shelter's dual identity

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Hero: full-bleed split — 60% photo / 40% headline + dual CTAs, no centered grid
- Feature sections: staggered card rows with photo-first, text offset below
- Stats: large number + short label in horizontal band across full width
- Pet carousel: horizontal scroll with oversized cards, partial peek of next card
- Footer: three-column asymmetric with mission statement spanning full width above

**Signature Elements:**
1. Red diagonal accent slash on section transitions (clip-path divider)
2. Teal pill badges on animal cards ("Available Now", "Needs Foster")
3. Paw-print watermark texture on off-white sections (subtle SVG pattern)

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Hover on pet cards: gentle scale + shadow lift, name slides up from bottom
- CTA buttons: fill sweep from left on hover (red → dark red, teal → dark teal)
- Section entrance: fade-up with slight Y translate, staggered for card grids

**Animation:**
- Hero text: word-by-word fade-in on load (0.1s stagger)
- Stats counter: count-up animation when scrolled into view
- Nav: slim red underline slides in on active link hover
- Pet cards: 200ms ease-out scale(1.03) on hover

**Typography System:**
- Display: Playfair Display (serif) — emotional weight for headlines
- Body: DM Sans (sans-serif) — clean, modern, highly legible
- Stat numbers: DM Sans 900 weight, oversized
- Labels/tags: DM Sans 600, uppercase, tracked

**Design Movement:** Bold Activist — inspired by modern animal rights campaigns and charity: water's visual language

**Core Principles:**
1. High-contrast impact: dark backgrounds with punchy color pops
2. Full-bleed photography with aggressive text overlays
3. Data as storytelling: impact numbers are heroes, not footnotes
4. Kinetic energy: diagonal layouts, overlapping elements, motion-forward

**Color Philosophy:**
- Dark charcoal base (#111827) with red (#C8102E) and teal (#0D9488) as neon accents
- High contrast for accessibility and visual punch
- Emotional intent: serious urgency — these animals need homes NOW

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Dark hero with massive headline, photo bleeding out of frame
- Diagonal section dividers throughout
- Overlapping photo + card elements for depth

**Signature Elements:**
1. Neon teal glow on key CTAs
2. Red horizontal rules as section separators
3. Bold uppercase display type

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Aggressive hover states with color inversion
- Parallax scrolling on hero images

**Animation:**
- Fast, punchy transitions
- Slide-in from sides for content blocks

**Typography System:**
- Display: Space Grotesk Bold
- Body: Inter Regular

3. Community-centered storytelling

## CHOSEN APPROACH: Editorial Warmth

**Design Philosophy:** Editorial Warmth — emotion-first asymmetric layout with Playfair Display + DM Sans typography, red (#C8102E) + teal (#0D9488) + warm off-white (#FAF7F2) palette. Every section leads with a bold animal face or human-animal moment before text. Red diagonal accent slashes mark section transitions. Stats are displayed as oversized counter numbers. Pet cards have a gentle hover lift with teal badge overlays.
