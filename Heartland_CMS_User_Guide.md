# Heartland Animal Shelter: No-Code Website Admin Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the visual Content Management System (CMS) built for the Heartland Animal Shelter website. This admin panel allows you to edit page layouts, manage adoptable animals, update site settings, and much more — all without writing a single line of code.

---

## 1. Accessing the Admin Panel

To access the content management tools, simply add `/admin` to the end of the website's URL.

-   **Live Site URL:** `https://[your-permanent-site-url].com`
-   **Admin Panel URL:** `https://[your-permanent-site-url].com/admin`

For the current development preview, the URL is:
-   `https://3000-iabowpxuur5aqgea23wgp-46d224e4.us2.manus.computer/admin`

Upon navigating to the admin URL, you will be taken directly to the main dashboard.

## 2. Navigating the Dashboard

The admin dashboard is organized into several tabs, each managing a different aspect of the website.

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Page Builder** | Visually edit the content and layout of your website's pages. |
| **Animals** | Add, edit, and manage all adoptable animal profiles. |
| **News & Events** | Create, publish, and manage news articles and event posts. |
| **Products** | Manage items in the online shop (e.g., merchandise). |
| **Orders** | View and manage orders placed through the online shop. |
| **Site Settings** | Configure global site details like your logo, contact info, and navigation. |

## 3. The Page Builder Tab

This is the most powerful feature of the CMS. It gives you full control over the structure and content of your pages.

### A. Editing a Page

First, select the page you wish to edit from the page tabs (e.g., Home, Adopt, About).

### B. Managing Sections

The page is built from a series of sections. You have full control over them:

-   **Reorder Sections:** Simply click and hold the drag handle (`::`) on the left of any section and drag it up or down to a new position.
-   **Edit Content & Layout:** Click the expand arrow (`▾`) on a section to open the editor. Here you can change text, upload photos, and modify the layout.
-   **Hide a Section:** Click the eye icon (`👁️`) to temporarily hide a section from the live site without deleting it.
-   **Duplicate a Section:** Click the copy icon (`❐`) to create an exact copy of a section, which you can then modify.
-   **Delete a Section:** Click the trash can icon (`🗑️`) to permanently remove a section.
-   **Add a New Section:** Click the `+ Add Section` button at the bottom to choose from 11 pre-designed layout templates.

### C. Editing Section Content

Inside a section's editor, you can modify:

-   **Layout:** Choose a different visual style for the section.
-   **Content:** Type directly into the `Headline`, `Subheadline`, and `Body text` fields.
-   **Buttons / CTAs:** Edit the text and URL for any buttons in the section.
-   **Photos:** Upload images by dragging them into the photo area, clicking to browse, or pasting an image URL.
-   **Colors:** Use the color pickers to change the background, text, and accent colors for that specific section.

### D. Saving

Once you are happy with your changes, click the **`Save Layout`** button at the top right to make them live.

## 4. The Animals Manager Tab

This tab is where you manage all the animal profiles for the adoption pages.

-   **Add an Animal:** Click the `+ Add Animal` button to open a form where you can enter the animal's details (name, species, breed, age, description, etc.) and upload their photo.
-   **Edit an Animal:** Click the `Edit` button on any animal's card to update its information.
-   **Search and Filter:** Use the search bar to find an animal by name, or use the dropdowns to filter by species or status (e.g., show only 
`Available` dogs).

## 5. The Site Settings Tab

This area controls the global settings for your entire website.

-   **Identity:** Set your site name, tagline, and upload your official logo and favicon.
-   **Contact:** Update your shelter’s physical address, phone number, email, and operating hours.
-   **Social:** Add links to your social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, etc.).
-   **Colors:** Define your primary, secondary, and accent brand colors that will be used as defaults across the site.
-   **Navigation:** Add, remove, or reorder the links in your main website navigation menu.
-   **Footer:** Edit the content displayed in the website’s footer.

After making changes in any of these sub-panels, be sure to click the **`Save Settings`** button.
